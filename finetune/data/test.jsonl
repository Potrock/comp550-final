I asked for the same\ncoverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you\naccording to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.\nAnyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's\nwhat I found (for a '93 Integra GS):\n\nAAA: ~$2000/yr.\nState Farm: 2614.92/yr.\nAllstate: 1220/yr.\n\nAAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about\n$200-300 back at the end of the year.\n\nStill, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm\nwants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be\nsuspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.\n\nAny comments?\n\nThanks,\nGregg L.

Changing your\nown applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can\njust XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately\nyou can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with\nicons which your application doesn't specifically own.\n\nIn my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in \nmy icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the\nicon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes\nany difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.\n\nThanks -\nScott :)\n. Relevant: True"}

As a catholic, I was told that a jew,\nbuddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not\nbelieve this.  Even more see atheists and pagans (I assume I would be \nlumped into this category) to be hellbound.

I asked for the same\ncoverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you\naccording to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.\nAnyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's\nwhat I found (for a '93 Integra GS):\n\nAAA: ~$2000/yr.\nState Farm: 2614.92/yr.\nAllstate: 1220/yr.\n\nAAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about\n$200-300 back at the end of the year.\n\nStill, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm\nwants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be\nsuspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.\n\nAny comments?\n\nThanks,\nGregg L.

The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.\nIt becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the\nwing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.\n\nIf they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force\ncompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).\n\nIf you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend\ninto,  then drag is reduced.   \n\nEssentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf\nremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are\nsubtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.\n\npat\n. Relevant: False"}

The dealer\ntold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to\ndisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.\nAt first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto\nbut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.
