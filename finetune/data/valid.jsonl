Phillips's words) \"too small\". \nIf a person's understanding of God is not allowed to grow and develop, it will\neventually become inadequate.  The grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a\ncomforting image in childhood becomes a joke.\n\nA therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they \"fire\nGod\".  What she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of\nGod to make room for a fuller one.  But she follows up by encouraging them to\n\"hire a new one\".  My guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing\nprocess, but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re-hire.\n\nbillh\n. Relevant: True"}

I asked for the same\ncoverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you\naccording to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.\nAnyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's\nwhat I found (for a '93 Integra GS):\n\nAAA: ~$2000/yr.\nState Farm: 2614.92/yr.\nAllstate: 1220/yr.\n\nAAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about\n$200-300 back at the end of the year.\n\nStill, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm\nwants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be\nsuspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.\n\nAny comments?\n\nThanks,\nGregg L.

I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP\nand DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also\nrunning TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure\non the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows\nclient, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?\n\nMy first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making\nTCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can\nnot run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated.\nThanks.\n. Relevant: True"}

Changing your\nown applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can\njust XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately\nyou can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with\nicons which your application doesn't specifically own.\n\nIn my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in \nmy icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the\nicon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes\nany difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.\n\nThanks -\nScott :)\n. Relevant: False"}

I went to a doctor and\npaid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches, leading to the\ndiagnostic that I am allergic to (June and Timothy) grass.\nI believe this. From now on it looks like 2 shots per week for\n6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. Each shot costs\n$20. Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system, I would\ncall that a racket. We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses\nhere, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office.\nApart from this issue, I was somewhat disappointed to find out\nthat you have to keep getting the shots forever. Is that right?\nThanks for information.\nEj   \n\n\n. Relevant: True"}
